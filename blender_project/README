Short description:
The project for computational modeling of spatial prepositions and spatial reasoning
uses Blender's 3D modeling capabilities augmented with python scripting to 
construct and process scenes in two domains: the blocks world and the "room world", 
comprised of ordinary everyday items, such as furniture, food, etc.

Blender supports scripting in Python and provides several custom libraries to 
interact with the Blender 3D engine. The libraries provide the API to perform 
typical modeling tasks, usually done manually via GUI, from code.

The fundamental Blender concept is a scene, which is a workspace, containing some 
set of 3D models with all the associated data, like coordinate system, lighting, 
physics, etc. Scenes are stored in *.blend files. In order to apply a script to 
some scene both must loaded into Blender, which can be done either manually, from 
inside the Blender or lauching the Blender executable with both the scene and script
file paths provided as command line parameters.

The annotation processing is just a loop that reads the annotations from a list 
(loaded from a file) and then calls Blender with the corresponding scene and script
to process it. The result of the script execution for a particular annotation 
is read from Blender output and saved for calculation of accuracy and interannotator 
agreement. Each annotation contains all the improtant information, such as the id 
of the scene is was created for (to load the right scene file), the user id (for 
agreement calculation), etc.

3D models for the scenes were mostly created by hand.

Project components:

Source files:

entity.py - source code for the Entity class
eval.py - code for evaluation of the annotation dataset (obsolete
and will probably be removed in the future)
eval_tests.py - updated evaluation code
geometry_utils.py - contains the code for some basic geometry primitives, e.g.,
computing various distances, shared volumes, etc.
main.py - the main source file
parser.py - parser for the annotations

Folders:
description - stores the Blender scenes related to the description task
truth_judgment - stores the Blender scenes related to the truth-judgment 
task
objects - stores the models of items used in the scenes
screenshots - used to store the screenshot of the scenes (for the annotation 
web-app)

Details:

entity.py

Used by main.py.
All the important objects in the scene are stored in a custom "Entity" class.
Since any compound model in Blender consists of multiple meshes, entity object
provides a unified way to manage such a model. In Blender, the complex models are
often modeled as a set of component models. For example, a model of a table might
consist of the tabletop box and four legs as the visible parts and also several 
invisible parts as well. Blender provides several ways to group objects together, 
e.g., by assigning a parent object to a set of objects, which enables the 
manipulation of the group as a whole. However, while it is easy to access the 
parent object through any of its children, the opposite is not computationally 
efficient.
The Entity class was introduced for two reasons:
1) Provide an efficient and unified access to all components of the composite models
2) Store in one place some useful precomputed values associated with an object, 
such as bounding boxes, centroids, etc.

eval_tests.py

Evaluation pipeline. Reads the annotations from a file and executes main.py in 
Blender with the given annotation as a parameter. It also keeps track of the results 
of evaluation and computes the interannotator agreement metrics (Cohen's kappa 
and weighted kappa)

geometry_utils.py

Used by main.py as a library of geometric primitives. Stores a bunch of functions
computing values related to vectors (cross-products, normals to planes), projections,
orientations, distances between points, lines, planes, meshes, etc.

parser.py

Parses the user annotations (English sentence) and extracts the relations, its 
arguements and their properties. Returns that data in structured form.

main.py

Main source file. Should be executed from inside Blender since it depends on Blender's
custom BPY library. Contains the functions for the prepositions and all of the code
 working with Blender primitives, e.g., for setting up the scene. Setting up the 
scene, that is loaded into Blender along main.py, includes initializing various 
global variables, creating entity objects from the Blender objects, etc.
Entry point - function main(). Annotation pipeline: 
1) reads annotation provided as a parameter 
2) parses the annotation and extracts the relation with arguements
3) tries to match the arguments to the candidate entities, based on the their description
in the annotation (color, type, etc.)
4) calls the corresponding relation function with all combination of candidate 
arguments to check if the relation holds.
5) prints the result to console
